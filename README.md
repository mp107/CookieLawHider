# CookieLawHider
This extension hides the informations about cookies required by law in the EU. It is designed to work on Opera 12.* browsers (including Opera Mobile Labs Extensions) but you can freely adapt it to the others.

### How it works?
It uses Javascript and CSS to hide unwanted elements on websites.
